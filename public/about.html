          This project is to showcase how I can use my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build
          a web pages. I also used Nodejs and SocketIO to build a chat application that allows multiple users
          send messages across to each other.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          The home page and about pages are simple HTML and CSS templates to convey information in a Semantic
          manner to users of the application. I imported fonts from Google Fonts for the font family of texts in the 
          website. I also used a mix of bootstrap styling and my own custom styling to style the pages.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3 text-justify">
          The chat page is a lot more complex and utilizes a lot of JavaScript code to ensure it's functionality. 
          Since, some boiler plate code which already handled the chat communication was provided, I focused on styling
          the chat page in a more presentable manner similar to how a standard chat application like Whatsapp would look like.
          I also extended certain JavaScript functionalities. These are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="mb-2">Using bootstrap toast notification components, I created a way for users on the chat page to be notified
            when someone joins or leaves the application. A toast notification displays this information for about 3 seconds
            before fading away.
          </li>
          <li>
            I added code to track users keyboard presses in order to figure out when they are typing a message in the input box 
            then I displayed a text just above the input field so other users are notified that a certain user is typing.
          </li>

                JavaScript is an interpreted programming language that is to provide interactivity in 
                web pages. It is also used in non browser environments such as Node.js to build server side 
                applications. JavaScript is used extensively across this application especially for the chat 
                page as it is the programming language in which the socket library is written in.
