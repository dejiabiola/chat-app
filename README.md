# chat-app
A simple socket.io and NodeJs powered chat application.

The application features 3 pages, an index (landing) page, about page(description of the project vision and technologies used) and a chat page which is basically the functional part of the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You must have nodejs and and npm installed on your device in order to run this application locally.

### Installation
Clone the repo from github to your local machine using
```git clone https://github.com/dejiabiola/chat-app.git```

In your working folder root, run the following command
```npm install```
This will install all the required dependencies for the application and create a node_modules folder.

Run `npm start` and then visit `localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Roadmap
This project is still in a very early stage and can be extended with a number of features. Some of them are:
- Create login and signup so the app can use actual user names rather than create random names everytime.
- Introduce a database to persist information (messages, authentication data).
